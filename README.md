# ExampleRazorLoginUsingJWT
Example login page created using Razor syntax that uses JSON web token (JWT) for authentication. 

An example of a login page that uses Razor syntax. Authentication is handled by JSON Web Token (JWT). This allows an encoded payload in JSON format to be sent between the authenticating service and the login page over the querystring. Therefore firewall, proxy server and other settings are avoided as all communication is via the querystring.
